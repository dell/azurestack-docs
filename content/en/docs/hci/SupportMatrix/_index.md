Azure Stack HCI version 22H2 reached end of support on May 31st, 2025. You will not receive monthly security and quality updates from Microsoft. Microsoft recommends that customers upgrade their operating system to 23H2 to continue receiving updates.

Dell Technologies has worked with Microsoft to validate the Azure Stack HCI 22H2 OS to Azure Stack HCI 23H2 OS upgrade on stretched clusters. Microsoft has provided the remediation in LCU 9B for the defect that caused metadata corruption on storage replica volumes when upgrading the host operating system. Instructions for implementing the operating system upgrade are now available.

For more information, see [Upgrade stretched clusters from Azure Stack HCI OS, version 22H2 to 23H2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-local/upgrade/upgrade-stretched-cluster-to-23h2?view=azloc-2509)
